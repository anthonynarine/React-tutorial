  // Generating a new project \\

1. npx create-react-app <project name>

2. To Start your project:
        1. cd into the project folder
        2. run npm start

3. To View your project:
        1. open your browser and navigate to
           localhost:3000

4. To Stop your project:
        1. ctrl + c

Since the bower does not run JSX the terminal(using the Dev Sever)
will convert Js into JSX for us. (see diagram in assets folder)


5. Files and Folders to Delete
    ~ public directory 
        favicon
        both logos
        manifest 
        robot :(
        Do NOT delete index.html
    
    ~ src directory 
        delete ALL files
        Create index.js file 
            This is the first file to be executed in the browser
            This is also the place we Create a Component to show
            on the scree. 


6. Creating a Component:
    1) Import the React and ReactDOM Libraries
        import React from 'react'; 
        import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
we need the above libraries to show a component on the screen
            A) The React library defines what a component is
               and how multiple components work
            B) The ReactDOM library know how to get a component
               to show up in the browser

    2) Get a refrence to the div with id root
        public directory line 31. This HTML file is the first 
        that gets loaded up into the browser, and then this file
        causes our bundled args files to eventually be loaded as well.
        see startup diagram.

        we give the below refrence to the div in the above file
        to tell React we want our application to show up inside that 
        element. This is done with the ReactDOM library

         const el = document.getElementById("root");

    3) Tell React to take control of that element

         const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(el);

    4)  Create a component

        components are just functions that return JSX
    
    function App() {
        return <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    }

    5) Show the component on the screen. 
    root.render(<App/>);  
        APP is passed in as a JSX element
